import Post from "../../components/post";

export const meta = {
  isPublished: false,
  date: `2017-10-09`,
  title: `Move files to the root of a Next.js project`,
  summary: `Need to place a file like sitemap.xml in the root of your Next.js project? Here's one way to do it.`,
  url: `/an-adventure-in-image-zooming`
};

export default Post;

## Add a script to your project

Create a file called `move-files-to-root-directory.js` in the root of your project. This script simply moves the files specified to the root directory.
```javascript
const fs = require(`fs`);

fs.copyFile(`./public/sitemap.xml`, `./out/sitemap.xml`, err => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(`sitemap.xml was copied to ./out`);
});
```

## Add an npm script to your `package.json`

Add a script to your `package.json`. I called it `post-export`, but you can call it whatever you like.
```javascript
// In your package.json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "post-export": "node move-public-files-to-root.js"
  }
  ...
}
```

## Update your build command

Update your build command to include the new npm script.

For example, I host this website on Netlify. Before adding this script, my build command looked like:
```bash
npm run export
```

And after...
```bash
npm run export && npm run post-export
```
